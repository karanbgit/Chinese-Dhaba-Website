			<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
			<h2>SMS MOBILE MESSAGE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
		<div class="head">
			<h3>Last revised: January 5, 2024</h3>
			<div class="contents">
				<p>We, together with our partner SpotHopper, are offering a mobile messaging program (the “Program”), which you agree to use and participate in subject to these Mobile Messaging Terms and Conditions (“Program Terms”). By opting in to or participating in the Program, you accept and agree to these Program Terms, including, without limitation, your agreement to resolve any disputes with us and/or SpotHopper through binding, individual-only arbitration, as detailed in the “Dispute Resolution” section below. These Program Terms are limited to the Program and are not intended to modify other agreements or terms and conditions that may govern the relationship between you and Us, or you and SpotHopper in other contexts.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="head">
			<h3>User Agreement to Receive Text Messages</h3>
			<div class="contents">
				<p>You agree to receive SMS mobile messages from Us and SpotHopper at the phone number you provided when you opted in to receive promotional notifications, and any additional or updated phone number you provide. Regardless of how you joined the Program, you agree that these Program Terms apply to your participation in the Program. You agree to receive autodialed, prerecorded, or predetermined mobile messages at the phone number you provided, and you understand that your consent to receive these messages is not required to make any purchase. These messages will include information on how to manage your subscription and may include special offers and other promotional content. While you consent to receive messages sent using an autodialer, the foregoing shall not be interpreted to suggest or imply that any or all of the mobile messages you receive from Us or SpotHopper are sent using an automatic telephone dialing system (“ATDS” or “autodialer”). Message and data rates may apply.</p>
			</div>
		</div>


		<div class="head">
			<h3>User Opt Out</h3>
			<div class="contents">
				<p>If you do not wish to continue participating in the Program or no longer agree to these Program Terms, you agree to reply STOP to any mobile message from Us or SpotHopper in order to opt out of the Program. You may continue to receive SMS messages while we process your request, and you may receive a mobile message confirming your decision to opt out. You understand and agree that the foregoing options are the only reasonable methods of opting out of the Program. You also understand and agree that any other method of opting out, including, but not limited to, texting words other than those set forth above or verbally requesting one of our employees to remove you from our list, is not a reasonable means of opting out.</p>
			</div>

		</div>


		<div class="head">
			<h3>Duty to Notify and Indemnify</h3>
			<div class="contents">
				<p>If at any time you intend to stop using the mobile telephone number that you provided to the Program, including canceling your service plan or selling or transferring the phone number to another party, you agree that you will complete the User Opt Out process set forth above prior to ending your use of the mobile telephone number. You understand and agree that your agreement to do so is a material part of these terms and conditions. You further agree that, if you discontinue the use of your mobile telephone number without notifying Us of such change, you agree that you will be responsible for all costs (including attorneys’ fees) and liabilities incurred by Us, SpotHopper, or any party that assists in the delivery of the mobile messages, as a result of claims brought by individual(s) who are later assigned that mobile telephone number. This duty and agreement shall survive any cancellation or termination of your agreement to participate in any of our Programs.</p>

			<p>YOU AGREE THAT YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD US AND SPOTHOPPER HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIM OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH YOUR DUTY TO NOTIFY US IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION, INCLUDING ANY CLAIM OR LIABILITY UNDER THE TELEPHONE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 47 U.S.C. § 227, et seq., OR SIMILAR STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS, AND ANY REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER RESULTING FROM US ATTEMPTING TO CONTACT YOU AT THE MOBILE TELEPHONE NUMBER YOU PROVIDED.</p>

		<div class="head">
			<h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
			<div class="contents">
				<p>In the event that there is a dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Us, or between you and SpotHopper or any other third-party service provider acting on Our behalf to transmit the mobile messages within the scope of the Program, arising out of or relating to the Program, federal or state statutory claims, common law claims, this Agreement, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, such dispute, claim, or controversy will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, determined through binding arbitration or, if applicable, in small claims court.</p>
				<p>Any arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules or, if applicable, the Consumer Arbitration Rules, of then in effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, this arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and the arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of Wisconsin, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Within ten (10) calendar days after the arbitration demand is served upon a party, the parties must jointly select an arbitrator with at least five years’ experience as an arbitrator and have experience with the subject matter of the dispute. If the parties do not agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) calendar days, a party may petition the AAA to appoint an arbitrator, under the applicable rules, who must satisfy the same experience requirements. In the event of a dispute, the arbitrator shall decide the enforceability and interpretation of this arbitration agreement in accordance with the “FAA”. The parties also agree that the AAA’s rules governing Emergency Measures of Protection shall apply in lieu of seeking emergency injunctive relief from a court. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and no party shall have rights of appeal except for those provided in section 10 of the FAA. If allowed for by the applicable rules, each party shall bear its share of the fees paid for the arbitrator and the administration of the arbitration; however, the arbitrator shall have the power to order one party to pay all or any portion of such fees as part of a well-reasoned decision. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to award attorneys’ fees only to the extent expressly authorized by statute or contract. Unless expressly allowed for by applicable law, the arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages and each party hereby waives any right to seek or recover punitive damages with respect to any dispute resolved by arbitration. The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and this agreement does not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration without the prior written consent of both parties, unless to protect or pursue a legal right. If any term or provision of this Section is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Section or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the parties hereby waive any right to a jury trial. This arbitration provision shall survive any cancellation or termination of your agreement to participate in any of our Programs.</p>

			<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
			<div class="contents">
				<p>You warrant and represent to Us that you have all necessary rights, power, and authority to agree to these Terms and perform your obligations hereunder, and nothing contained in this Agreement or in the performance of such obligations will place you in breach of any other contract or obligation. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Any new features, changes, updates or improvements of the Program shall be subject to this Agreement unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing. We reserve the right to change this Agreement from time to time. Any updates to this Agreement shall be communicated to you. You acknowledge your responsibility to review this Agreement from time to time and to be aware of any such changes. By continuing to participate in the Program after any such changes, you accept this Agreement, as modified.</p>
